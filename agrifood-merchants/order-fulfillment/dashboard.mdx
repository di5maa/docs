## Dashboard Layout

The dashboard is divided into three main areas to help you process orders efficiently:

1. **Header & Quick Stats:** Immediate visibility on order status and totals.
2. **Left Column (Details):** Customer notes, item lists, payment breakdowns, and fulfillment timeline.
3. **Right Column (Actions):** Management tools, customer contact details, and driver information.

## 1. Quick Stats & Header

At the top of the panel, you will find high-level metrics for the specific order.

- **Order ID & Status:** Unique reference number (e.g., `#12345`) and the current status pill (e.g., `PENDING`, `COMPLETED`).
- **Timeline:** Shows when the order was placed relative to now.
- **Total Value:** The final order total including all fees and tips.
- **Fulfillment Type:** Indicates if the order is for **Delivery** or **Pickup**.
- **Distance/Time:** \* _For Delivery:_ Shows the distance to the customer (e.g., "3.5 km").
  - _For Pickup:_ Shows how long ago the order was placed (e.g., "15 min ago").

### Printing Invoices

## 4. Customer CRM & Support

### Contact Options

You can contact the customer directly from the dashboard:

| Action      | Icon | Function                                                                                                                      |
| :---------- | :--- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Call**    | 📞   | Launches your device's phone dialer with the customer's number.                                                               |
| **Message** | 💬   | Opens the internal **Chat System**. If you haven't messaged this customer before, it automatically starts a new conversation. |

### Driver Assignment

If a driver has been assigned to the order by the system, their details will appear in the **Delivery Driver** card.

- **Name:** Name of the courier.
- **Status:** Typically shows "Assigned" once a driver accepts the job.

## Common Questions

**Why don't I see the "Update Status" or "Picklist" buttons?**

These features are hidden for **Restaurant** accounts because they typically use a separate Kitchen Display System (KDS) flow. If you are a retail or grocery vendor and cannot see these buttons, please contact support to verify your account type.

**Can I print invoices for thermal printers?**

Yes, the **Print Invoice** feature generates a responsive PDF that scales well for both standard office printers and smaller receipt (thermal) printers.
