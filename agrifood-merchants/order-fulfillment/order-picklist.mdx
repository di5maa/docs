## Overview

Instead of printing paper lists, staff can use the Picklist to:

- Track packing progress in real-time.
- Scan item barcodes to verify products.
- Organize items by aisle or category.

## Interface Guide

### 1. Progress Header

At the top of the screen, you will see the **Order Number** and a **Progress Circle**.

- **Visual Tracking:** The circle fills up as you mark items as "Picked".
- **Counter:** Shows exactly how many items are done vs. total (e.g., `12/45`).

### 2. Scanning & Search

The Picklist offers two ways to locate items:

#### 📷 Barcode Scanner

Tap the **SCAN** button with the QR icon to open the camera.

- **Point & Scan:** Align the camera with the product's barcode.
- **Flashlight:** Use the ⚡ icon in the scanner view for low-light areas.
- **Feedback:**
  - 🟢 **Success:** Screen flashes green, device vibrates, and the item is marked as picked.
  - 🟠 **Duplicate:** Device gives a heavy vibration if you scan an item you've already picked.
  - 🔴 **Error:** Device vibrates if the scanned item is not in the specific order.

<Note>
  **Please note, **product SKU in Local Pass Business account **must match product barcode **to mark it as "packaged." 
</Note>

#### 🔍 Manual Search

Use the search bar to type an item name (e.g., "Gala Apples") or manually enter a code if the barcode is damaged.

## 3. Picking Items

The list is automatically organized by **Category** (e.g., Produce, Dairy, General) to help you navigate your store efficiently.

### Marking Items

- **Tap an Item:** Tap anywhere on the item card to mark it as **Done**.
- **Visual Cues:**
  - **Unpicked:** White background, clear text.
  - **Picked:** Green background, green border, and completed text.

### Item Details & Variations

Some items may have specific variations (e.g., "Size: Large" or "Flavor: Strawberry").

- **Information:** Visual tags show preparation time (e.g., "1d Prep") and unit measurements (e.g., "500g").
- **View Options:** If an item has complex options, **press and hold** (or tap details) to see a popup list of selected modifiers and their prices.

<Warning>
  **Attention Required:** Always check the quantity box on the right side of the item card. It displays the required amount in large, bold text (e.g., **5** Qty).
</Warning>
