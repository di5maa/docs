## Page Overview

The **Create Product** page is designed to handle both retail and wholesale product definitions. It includes smart features like AI-generated descriptions and dynamic bundle configurations.

**Status Indicators:**

- **Draft:** The product is saved in your inventory but **not visible** to customers in the marketplace.
- **Published:** The product is live and immediately purchasable.

<Info>
  **Note:** Editing a product that is already "Published" will keep it live. If you wish to hide a product without deleting it, you must archive it or change its status to Draft.
</Info>

## 1. Basic Information

### Product Name

Enter the display name of the product.

- **Format:** Capitalize the first letter of every word (e.g., _"Organic Gala Apples"_).
- **Requirement:** Mandatory field.

### Description & AI Assistant

A detailed description of the produce, origin, or taste profile.

{% hint style="success" %} **AI Feature:** Tap the **"Ask Kyla AI to generate description"** button. This opens the AI Assistant which analyzes your product name and automatically generates a professional, sales-oriented description. {% endhint %}

## 2. Pricing & Units

This section defines how the product is sold and measuring units.

### Price Configuration

- **Regular Price (\$):** The standard selling price per unit.
- **Promotion Price (\$):** (Optional) A discounted price. If set, a "On Sale" badge will typically appear on the listing.

### Unit Measurement

Define the quantity per unit sold (e.g., 500g, 1kg, 1lb).

- **Standard Units:** Select from the predefined dropdown options (e.g., kg, lb, g, oz).
- **Custom Units:** Toggle the **"Custom Order"** switch to define specific measurements not listed in the standard dropdown.
  - _Example:_ "per crate", "per bunch", "per box".
  - _Input Required:_ `Unit Quantity` (e.g., 1) + `Unit Measurement` (e.g., Box).

### Sales Model (Wholesale vs. Retail)

Toggle the specific sales channels for this item using the switches provided:

1. **Retail:** Available to individual consumers.
2. **Wholesale:** Available to B2B buyers (restaurants, bulk purchasers).

{% hint style="info" %} **Hybrid Selling:** You can enable **Both** options simultaneously if you sell the same SKU to both individual customers and business accounts. {% endhint %}

## 3. Categorization & Search

Proper categorization ensures customers find your products in the marketplace.

### Critical Categorization Rules

The system uses a strict referencing system for categories to ensure search indexing works correctly.

1. **Selection Required:** You typically cannot type a free-text category. You must select from the validated list provided by the platform.
2. **Backend Indexing:** When you publish a product, the system runs an update on the **Marketplace Category Index**. This ensures your product appears immediately in search filters.

- **Category:** Broad classification (e.g., "Fruits").
- **Subcategory:** Specific classification (e.g., "Apples").

{% hint style="warning" %} **Missing a Category?** If the dropdown does not contain the specific subcategory you need, click the **"Don't see your product category?"** link. This opens a request form to add a new validated subcategory to the system. {% endhint %}

- **Dietary Labels:** Select all that apply (e.g., Organic, Gluten-Free, Vegan). These appear as visual badges on the product card.
- **Search Keywords:** Add specific tags to improve search result visibility (e.g., "Red", "Sweet", "Crunchy").
  - _How to use:_ Type a keyword in the text field and tap the **"+" (check)** icon to add it. Tap the **"X"** on a tag to remove it.

## 4. Media

Upload high-quality images of your product to attract customers.

- **Upload Photo:** Buttons are provided to select an image from your device gallery.
- **Supported Formats:** JPEG, JPG.
- **Recommendation:** Use high-resolution, square (1:1) images for the best display layout.

<Info>
  **Fallback Image:** If you do not upload an image, the system will automatically assign a default "Food Placeholder" image to your product listing. 
</Info>

## 5. Inventory & Logistics

### Stock Management

- **Stock Level:** Enter the current available quantity.
- **SKU:** (Stock Keeping Unit) Enter your internal reference code for inventory tracking.

### Pickup Locations

Select the specific service locations where this product is available for pickup.

- **Multi-Location Support:** You can add or remove multiple locations based on where the stock is physically held.
- **Default:** It will often default to your primary registered address.

## 6. Advanced Options

### Product Bundles

Toggle the **"Product Bundle"** switch if this item consists of multiple other products (e.g., "Fruit Basket", "Sampler Pack").

- **Action:** When enabled, a list of your existing products will appear. Select the specific items that are included in this bundle.

### Cross-Selling

Toggle **"Cross-selling item"** to mark this product as an add-on suggestion. These items are often recommended to customers during checkout when they purchase related items.

## 7. Saving & Publishing

Once the form is filled, use the action buttons at the bottom of the page.

{% hint style="danger" %} **Mandatory Requirement:** You **must** check the box "I have reviewed and agree to the Local Pass Terms & Conditions" before the Save or Publish buttons will function. The system prevents any database writes until this is checked. {% endhint %}
