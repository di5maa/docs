## Menu Categories

Your menu is organized into horizontal categories (e.g., "Starters", "Mains", "Drinks") at the top of the page. This navigation bar determines what products are displayed in the list below.

### Navigation & Status

- **Active Category:** The category currently being viewed is highlighted in **green** (or your primary theme color). Use this visual cue to know exactly which section of the menu you are editing.
- **Item Count:** Each category pill displays a small number indicating how many items are inside.
- **Scrolling:** If you have many categories, you can swipe or scroll horizontally to reveal them all.

### Creating a Category

1. Click the **"Add category"** button at the far right of the category bar.
2. A dialog will open asking for the **Category Name** and a short **Description**.
3. Click **Save** to create the new section.

<Tip>
  **First Time Setup:** If you see a yellow warning banner stating _"Before you create any products..."_, it means you have no categories yet. You must create at least one category to start adding items. 
</Tip>

## Managing Products

The main area of the screen displays the product list for the selected category.

### Visual Status Indicators

The interface uses color and text styling to give you an instant overview of item status:

- **Standard Text:** The item is **Published** and available for order.
- **Red Strikethrough:** The item is marked as **Out-of-stock**. Customers cannot order this item.
- **<kbd>[soon-to-go] Badge:</kbd>** A green text indicator appears above items marked for quick sale (usually for end-of-day inventory clearance).

### Adding & Editing

- **Add Item:** Click the large **"Add item"** button at the bottom of the list to open the full configuration form. For details on filling out the product form, refer to the [<kbd>Menu Item Configuration</kbd>](/restaurants/menu/add-new-item)<kbd> guide. </kbd>
- **Quick Edit:** Tap any product card to open the quick-edit dialog for immediate changes to price or description.
- **Options Menu:** Tap the **three dots** icon on any product card to access advanced options or delete the item.

### Reordering Items (Drag & Drop)

You can customize the sequence of items to prioritize high-margin dishes or specials.

1. **Long press and hold** on a product card.
2. **Drag** it to a new position in the list and release.
3. **Save Changes:** A **"Save"** button will appear in the category header as soon as you change the order. You **must click Save** to publish the new arrangement to the customer app.

<Warning>
  **Unsaved Changes:** If you leave the category or page without clicking "Save" after reordering, the items will revert to their previous order. 
</Warning>

## Bulk Actions

The Bulk Action Mode allows you to apply changes to multiple products simultaneously, saving you from editing items one by one.

### Using Bulk Mode

1. **Select:** Tap the **checkbox** icon on the left side of any product card. The interface will switch to selection mode.
2. **Multi-Select:** Continue tapping checkboxes on other products to add them to your group.
3. **Deselect:** Tap a checked box again to remove it from the selection.

### Available Bulk Tools

Once items are selected, a floating action bar appears at the bottom of the screen with three powerful tools:

| Tool               | Function                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Update Status**  | Instantly change the visibility of all selected items.   **Options:**   • **Published:** Visible and orderable.   • **Draft:** Hidden from customers, saved for later.   • **Archive:** Removed from active lists but kept in history. |
| **Set Discount %** | Apply a percentage discount (e.g., 20%) to all selected items.   _Note: This automatically calculates the "Promotion Price" based on the regular price for every selected item._                                                       |
| **Soon-to-Go**     | Marks selected items with a "Soon-to-Go" badge. Use this for items you want to clear out quickly before they expire.                                                                                                                   |

## QR Menu

You can instantly generate a printable QR code that links directly to your digital menu.

1. Click the **"QR Menu"** button located at the top of the page, next to the page title.
2. A bottom sheet will slide up displaying your unique QR code.
3. You can show this to customers for scanning or take a screenshot to print it for tables.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                                   | Solution                                                                                                                                                                      |
| :-------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **"Before you create any products..."** | You see a yellow warning banner. This means you have no categories yet. You must create at least one category before you can add products.                                    |
| **Changes not showing**                 | If you reordered items but the customer app hasn't changed, ensure you clicked the **"Save"** button that appeared after dragging the items.                                  |
| **Item shows strikethrough**            | If an item name has a line through it and appears red/grey, it is currently marked as **Out-of-stock**. Use the bulk update or individual edit to set it back to "Published". |
