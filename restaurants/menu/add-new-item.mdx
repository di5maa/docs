## Basic Information

When you open the product editor (Add or Edit mode), start by configuring the core identity of your item.

### Core Details

- **Name:** The display name of the item as it appears to customers. Use clear, capitalized names (e.g., "Double Cheeseburger").
- **Description:** A detailed explanation of the dish, ingredients, and potential allergens. 

  <Tip>
    **Use AI for Speed**\
    Click the **"Ask Kyla to generate description"** button (Sparkles icon) next to the description field. Our AI will analyze your product name and generate a mouth-watering description automatically. 
  </Tip>
- **Preparation Time:** An approximate time (in minutes) it takes to prepare this specific item. This helps calculate accurate delivery/pickup estimates.

### Pricing Strategies

Manage how your product is priced and displayed.

1. **Regular Price:** The standard selling price.
2. **Promotion Price (Optional):** If you enter a value here, the system will:
   - Cross out the regular price.
   - Display the promotion price.
   - Show the item as "On Sale."

     <Info>
       **Note, **promotion price is a separate value from a standalone **Promotion** that you run at the store level. 
     </Info>

## Media & Gallery

Visuals are the #1 driver for menu conversion. You can manage your product imagery directly from this form.

- **Upload Photo:** Upload a new image directly from your device.
- **Gallery:** Select from images you have previously uploaded to your media library.

<Warning>
  **File Requirements:** The system supports **JPEG** and **JPG** formats. Ensure your images are high-quality and centered, as they may be cropped for different device sizes. 
</Warning>

## Product Visibility & Flags

Toggle specific attributes to change how the product is displayed or recommended in the app.

| Setting                | Function                          | Impact on App                                                                                 |
| :--------------------- | :-------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Featured item**      | Highlights the product.           | Adds a "Featured" badge to the card and may place it in a special carousel on your menu page. |
| **Cross-selling item** | Suggests the product at checkout. | Prompts the user to add this item (e.g., drinks, sides) right before they pay.                |

## Menu Options & Modifiers

If your product has variations (like sizes) or add-ons (like toppings), use the **Menu Options** configuration tool.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Option Group">
    Click the **"This item has options"** button (or the **\+** icon) to create a container for your choices. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Logic" stepNumber={2}>
    Define how the customer interacts with this group: \
    - **Name:** e.g., "Select Size", "Choice of Sauce". \
    - **Required:** Toggle **ON** if a choice is mandatory (e.g., Size). Toggle **OFF** for optional add-ons. \
    - **Multiple Selection:** Toggle **ON** to allow selecting more than one option (e.g., "Add Extra Toppings"). Toggle **OFF** for single-choice lists (e.g., "Cook Style").
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Choices" stepNumber={3}>
    Add specific items to the group: \
    - **Name:** "Small", "Medium", "Large". \
    - **Price:** Enter the _additional cost_ for this choice. Enter `0.00` if it's free.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Managing Choices

- **Reorder:** Use the **Up/Down arrows** to change the order in which choices appear to the customer.
- **Remove:** Click the **Trash** icon to delete a specific choice or an entire option group.

## Publishing Changes

Once configuration is complete:

1. Click the **Publish** button at the bottom of the form.
2. The system will validate your entries (e.g., ensuring a name and price exist).
3. A confirmation dialog will appear: _"Product has been published/updated."_
4. The item is now live.

### Status Indicators

In the top right corner of the editor, you will see a status badge:

- **Draft:** The item is being created.
- **Published:** The item is live.
- **Out-of-stock:** The item is currently unavailable to customers. (To change this, use the main inventory toggle on the menu list page).
