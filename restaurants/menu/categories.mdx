## Creating & Editing Categories

To access category settings, click the **"Add category"** button on the main menu page, or tap the **Edit** icon (pencil) on an existing category's quick menu.

### Category Details

When configuring a category, you will need to provide the following information:

1. **Name:** The title of the category as seen by customers (e.g., "Signature Burgers").
2. **Description:** A brief summary of what this section contains. This is optional but helpful for SEO and user experience.
3. **Display Order:** An important numeric field. Categories are sorted based on this number (e.g., `1` appears first, `10` appears last). 

   <Tip>
     **Organization Tip:** Use gaps in your numbering (e.g., 10, 20, 30) instead of sequential numbers (1, 2, 3). This allows you to easily insert a new category in between later without renumbering everything. 
   </Tip>

### Publishing Status

You can control the visibility of entire sections of your menu using the status controls in the settings form or the quick-action dialog.

- **Active / Published:** The category and its contents are visible to customers.
- **Inactive / Unpublished:** The category is hidden from the customer app. Use this for seasonal menus or categories that aren't ready yet.
- **Draft:** Indicates a newly created category that hasn't been published yet.

To change the status:

- Click **"Publish"** to make a draft or inactive category live.
- Click **"Change to Inactive"** or **"Unpublish"** to hide a currently live category.

## Organizing Your Menu

### Moving Products Between Categories

Sometimes you need to move an item from one section to another (e.g., moving a seasonal special to the main menu).

1. Open the **Move Category** tool (usually accessible via the product's context menu).
2. **Select Category:** Choose the destination category from the dropdown list.
3. **Transfer Mode:**
   - **Move (Default):** The item is removed from the _current_ category and added to the _new_ category.
   - **Keep item in the same category (Toggle ON):** The item is added to the new category but _also stays_ in the current one. This effectively duplicates the link, allowing the same item to appear in multiple places (e.g., a "Side Salad" appearing in both "Sides" and "Starters").
4. Click **Save** to confirm the transfer.

### Deleting Categories

If a category is no longer needed:

1. Open the category options (Edit dialog).
2. Click the **Delete** button (Trash icon).
3. Confirm the action.

\<Warning\> **Safety Check:** The system may prevent deletion or warn you if the category still contains active products. It is best practice to move or delete all products inside a category before deleting the category itself. \</Warning\>

## Quick Actions

For faster management, you can use the **Quick Action Dialog** (accessed by tapping the category name or menu icon):

- **Edit:** Opens the full settings form.
- **Publish/Unpublish:** Toggles visibility instantly.
- **Delete:** Removes the category.

## Bulk Discount & Status (Category Level)

While managing a category, you can apply bulk changes to the products inside it using the **Bulk Action** interface (triggered when selecting multiple items):

| Action             | Description                                                                                                    |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Set Discount %** | Enter a percentage (e.g., "20") to automatically calculate sale prices for all selected items in the category. |
| **Update Status**  | Bulk change selected items to **Published**, **Draft**, or **Archive**.                                        |
| **Soon-to-Go**     | Quickly mark selected items as "Soon-to-Go" to encourage sales of inventory that needs to move fast.           |
