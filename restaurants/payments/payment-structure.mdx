## Accessing Payments

1. Log in to the Vendor Dashboard.
2. Navigate to the **Payments** tab in the sidebar menu (or the drawer menu on mobile devices).

## Setting Up Payouts

If your account is not yet configured to receive payments, the system will present the appropriate setup option based on your account status.

### Option 1: New Account Setup

If you are a new partner setting up for the first time:

1. Click the **Set up payment** button.
2. A secure form will appear (modal). Enter your business details, bank account information, and tax details.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to create your connected Stripe account.

### Option 2: Linking Multiple Locations

_Available only for vendors managing multiple stores under one login._

If you already have a Stripe account connected to another store on the platform:

1. Click the **Import existing ID** button.
2. A dialog will confirm: _"We have found an existing Stripe Id in other locations."_
3. Click **CONFIRM** to link this store to your existing payout account instantly.

### Option 3: Completing Onboarding

If your setup was interrupted or Stripe requires additional verification (KYC):

1. You will see a banner stating: _"You need to provide more information..."_
2. Click the **Complete onboarding** button.
3. You will be redirected to **Stripe Express** to upload required ID documents or verify bank details.
4. Once verified, you will be redirected back to the dashboard, and your status will update automatically.

## Managing Your Account

Once your account shows **Charges Enabled**, the interface changes to provide account management tools.

## Vendor Earnings

The **Vendor Earnings** section at the bottom of the page provides a snapshot of your financial performance.
