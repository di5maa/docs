title: "Creating a New Promotion"
---

## 1. General Information

- **Title (Internal):** Enter a name for your reference (e.g., "Summer Lunch Special"). This title is only visible to your team, not customers.
- **Description (Internal):** Add optional notes about the promotion's goal or target audience.

## 2. Discount Method

Choose how the customer redeems the offer.

- **Automatic Discount:** (Recommended) The discount applies automatically to the cart as soon as the rules are met. This provides the smoothest checkout experience.

## 3. Configuring the Offer

The configuration fields will change depending on the **Promotion Type** you selected.

### For "Buy X Get Y"

1. **Customer Buys:** Click "Browse" to select the specific products that a customer must buy to trigger the deal.
2. **Customer Gets:** Define the reward for the second item:
   - **Percentage:** (e.g., "Buy a Burger, get the second 50% off").
   - **Fixed Amount:** (e.g., "Buy a Pizza, get \$5.00 off the next one").
   - **Free:** (e.g., "Buy one, get one free").
3. **Minimum Requirements:**
   - **Minimum Quantity:** The customer must have at least X items in their cart.
   - **Minimum Purchase (\$):** The customer must spend a minimum dollar amount.

### For "Amount Off Order"

1. **Discount Type:** Choose between a **Percentage (%)** or a **Fixed Amount (\$)**.
2. **Discount Value:** Enter the numerical value (e.g., "15" for 15% off).
3. **Minimum Requirements:**
   - **No minimum requirements:** The discount applies to any order.
   - **Minimum purchase amount:** Set a dollar threshold (e.g., "Spend \$30 to get \$5 off").
   - **Minimum quantity of items:** Set an item count threshold.

### For "Product Discount"

1. **Select Products:** Choose the specific items from your menu that will be discounted.
2. **Discount Value:** Set the Percentage or Fixed Amount off for these items.
3. **Conditions:** (Optional) You can make this discount conditional.
   - Example: "Get 20% off the Spicy Burger" (Product Discount) ... "when you spend \$20+" (Minimum Purchase Requirement).

## 4. Active Dates

Set the duration of your promotion.

- **Start Date:** Select the date and time the promotion becomes valid. If left blank, it defaults to "Now".
- **End Date:** (Optional) Select a date and time for the promotion to expire automatically.

## 5. Usage Limits

Manage your budget and liability by setting strict limits.

- **Limit number of times:** Sets a total cap on redemptions across _all_ customers (e.g., "First 100 orders only").
- **Limit to one use per customer:** Ensures a specific user cannot redeem the same offer more than once.

## 6. Visibility

- **Featured:** Toggle this **ON** to pin the promotion to the "Featured Promotions" carousel on your storefront. This is highly recommended for time-sensitive or high-value offers to increase visibility.

## 7. Saving and Status

When you are finished configuring the promotion, choose one of the following actions:

- **Save as Draft:** (Gray Button) Saves your settings but keeps the promotion **inactive**. It will not be visible to customers or applied to carts. Use this for preparing campaigns in advance.
- **Save:** (Green Button) Saves the promotion and immediately sets it to **Active** (provided the Start Date has arrived).
