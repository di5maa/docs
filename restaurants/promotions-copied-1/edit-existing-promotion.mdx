## 1. Modifying General Details

The following internal details can be updated to help you organize your campaigns:

- **Internal Title:** Update the name used for your own reference.
- **Description:** Modify the internal notes regarding the promotion.

## 2. Changing the Discount Method

You can switch how the discount is applied, even after the promotion has been created:

- **Automatic Discount:** Switch to this to apply the discount immediately when cart conditions are met.
- **Discount Code:** Switch to this to require a code.
  - **Code Name:** You can edit the existing code string or generate a new random code.
  - _Note: changing the code on an active promotion will immediately invalidate the old code._

## 3. Updating Offer Logic

Depending on the Promotion Type, you can adjust the specific rules.

<Note>
  **Note:** You cannot change the fundamental "Type" (e.g., changing a "Buy X Get Y" to "Amount Off Order") once created. You must create a new promotion for a different type.
</Note>

### Values and Requirements

- **Reward Value:** Update the **Percentage (%)** or **Fixed Amount (\$)** being offered.
- **Minimums:** Adjust the **Minimum Purchase Amount** or **Minimum Quantity** of items required to trigger the discount.
- **Products:**
  - Click **"Browse"** to change which products are eligible for the discount.
  - Use the **trash icon** next to a listed product to remove it from the promotion.

## 4. Scheduling and Duration

- **Start Date:** Modify when the promotion begins.
- **End Date:** Enable or disable the end date switch. If enabled, pick a new expiration date and time.

## 5. Usage Limits and Visibility

- **Total Usage Limit:** Toggle the switch to define a specific number of times this discount can be redeemed in total across all customers.
- **Per Customer Limit:** Toggle "Limit to one use per customer" to restrict or allow repeat redemptions by the same user.
- **Featured Status:** Toggle **Featured** on or off. Turning this ON puts the promotion in the featured carousel on your storefront.

## 6. Saving Changes

When you are done editing, you have two options to save your changes:

### Save as Draft

Clicking **Save as Draft** will:

1. Save all your changes.
2. **Deactivate** the promotion immediately.
3. Set the status to **Draft**. _Use this if you want to pull a live promotion offline to work on it without deleting it._

### Publish

Clicking **Publish** will:

1. Save all your changes.
2. **Activate** the promotion immediately (assuming the Start Date has passed).
3. Ensure the promotion is live and usable by customers.
