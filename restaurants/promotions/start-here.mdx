## Types of Promotions

We currently support two distinct types of promotions, each serving a different strategic purpose for your business.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Amount of order" icon="sparkles">
    **Mechanism:** A flat currency discount applied to the total order value (e.g., "Spend \$30, save \$5").

    - **Best for:** Increasing **Average Order Value (AOV)**. By setting a minimum spend requirement just above your average basket size, you incentivize customers to add "one more item" to unlock the deal.
    - **Customer Experience:** The discount is applied **automatically** at checkout once the customer's cart meets the criteria.
    - **Visibility:** These often appear as "tags" on your store listing in the marketplace, helping you stand out in search results.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Buy X Get Y" icon="money-bill-1">
    **Mechanism:** Discounts specific products or collections when a customer purchases a qualifying item (e.g., "Buy a Burger, get a Drink for 50% off" or "Buy one Pizza, get one free").

    - **Best for:**
      - **New Product Launch:** Encourage customers to try a new item by pairing it with a best-seller.
      - **Inventory Management:** Quickly move stock of specific items (e.g., perishables) by bundling them.
    - **Customer Experience:** Users see the offer details on your storefront. Once they meet the requirement (buying Product X), they are presented with the option to claim Product Y.
    - **Constraints:** Currently, this promotion type supports linking **one specific product** as the "Get Y" reward.
  </Card>
</Columns>

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Individual Product Sale (Standalone)" icon="sparkles">
    **Mechanism:** Setting a specific "Promotion Price" directly on an item's configuration page, independent of a cart rule.

    - **Best for:** Highlighting specific menu items to drive volume without complex requirements.
    - **Customer Experience:** The item appears with its original price crossed out and the new sale price highlighted.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Soon-to-Go" icon="sparkles">
    **Mechanism:** Tagging specific items as "Soon-to-Go" via the Menu Management bulk tools.

    - **Effect:** This applies a clearance sale price to the item and adds a specific badge.
    - **Best for:** Clearing perishable inventory at the end of the day to reduce food waste. These items often get boosted visibility in "Rescue" or "Eco-friendly" sections of the marketplace.
  </Card>
</Columns>

<Warning>
  **Stacking Warning:** Individual product discounts are applied **in addition** to order-level promotions. For example, if you discount a Burger to \$5 (down from \$10) and also run a "Spend \$20, Get \$5 Off" promo, a customer purchasing 4 sale burgers will receive both the item discount AND the order discount.
</Warning>

## Creating a Promotion

1. Navigate to the **Promotions** tab in your dashboard.
2. Click the **"Create promotion +"** button in the top right corner.
3. Select your promotion type and configure the rules (minimum spend, specific products, discount value).
4. **Dates:** Set a **Start Date** and **End Date** to schedule campaigns in advance.

## Managing Promotions

Your dashboard gives you a comprehensive view of all campaigns.

### Featured Promotions

The top section of the page displays a carousel of your **Featured Promotions**. These are typically high-priority offers that are highlighted on your storefront.

- **Visual Cues:**
  - **Green Card:** Active promotion currently live to customers.
  - **Gray/Neutral Card:** Draft promotion (not yet visible).
- **Quick Actions:** Each card shows the discount value (e.g., "30%" or "\$5.00"). Use the **Edit** or **Remove** buttons directly on the card to modify them.

### All Promotions List

Below the featured section is a detailed data table of every promotion you have created.

- **Status:** Quickly see if a promo is **Active** or **Draft**.
- **Used:** This column tracks the number of times customers have successfully redeemed the offer, helping you measure ROI.

<Note>
  **Analytics Tip:** Periodically review the "Used" count in the table. If a promotion has low usage, consider lowering the minimum spend requirement or changing the "Buy X" trigger product to something more popular.
